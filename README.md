# Excel Takeaways
**Difference Between VLOOKUP and INDEX-MATCH Formulas in Excel?**
**VLOOKUP**
   Searches vertically from left to right
   Needs the lookup value in the first column
   It is slower on large datasets
   **VLOOKUP Formula** **=VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_range, column_number, [exact_match])**
   
**INDEX-MATCH**
   Much more flexible
   Can look left, right, up, or down
   It is faster and more efficient in large workbooks
   **INDEX-MATCH Formula** **=INDEX(return_range, MATCH(lookup_value, lookup_range, 0))**
